# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator-proyect-form-freeCodeCamp-
This project is part of the Data Analysis with Python course on freeCodeCamp. It involves creating a function that calculates various statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum) for a 3x3 matrix derived from a list of 9 numbers.

Functionality
The calculate() function takes a list of 9 numbers, converts it into a 3x3 NumPy array, and returns a dictionary with the following statistics:

Mean: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
Variance: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
Standard Deviation: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
Max: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
Min: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
Sum: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
If the input list has less than or more than 9 numbers, a ValueError will be raised.
